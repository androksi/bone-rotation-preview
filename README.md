# Bone Rotation Preview
An easy tool to get the rotation of the character bones.

## How to use
Basically, all you need to do is start the resource on your server. Once running, type `/pbone` to toggle the window.

## Features
- Add bone to list
- Remove bone, when selected
- Preview the rotation on your character
- Sliders to change the rotation (yaw, pitch, roll)
- Press `right mouse button` and hold to toggle cursor

## What's the purpose?
People may want to create animations or whatever their creativity tells. I was in need of something like this, so I did one by myself, and now, I'm sharing with the community. Hope you guys like it! You are allowed to edit and use the way you prefer. But **please**, do not sell.
